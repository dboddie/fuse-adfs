Introduction
------------

The ``fuse_adfs`` module provides a Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE_) utility
for presenting the contents of ADFS floppy disc images as a mountable
filing system on Linux, relying on the ``ADFSlib`` module for its image
reading facilities.

With this filing system, disc images can be mounted in the same way as floppy
discs and CDROMs, and navigated at the command line or with a file manager.
The filing system translates ADFS-style filenames to Unix-friendly ones and
adds suffixes to filenames to help applications recognize certain types of
files.


Requirements
------------

This utility requires both FUSE_ and the `Python bindings package for FUSE`_.
The Python bindings need to be obtained from the FUSE project site - see the
following Wiki page for more information::

  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FusePython

Follow the instructions given in the package for the Python bindings to install
them. Once this has been done, the ``fuse_adfs`` utility can be installed.


Installing fuse_adfs
--------------------

Enter the ``fuse-adfs`` directory and type::

  python setup.py build

Then, as root, type::

  python setup.py install


Mounting an image
-----------------

Before the ``fuse_adfs.py`` script can be run, the kernel module that provides
the userspace support must be loaded. The ``fuse_setup.py`` script provided
can be run as root to load the ``fuse`` kernel module as required.

Alternatively, you can type the following as root::

  modprobe fuse

As a normal user, you can now mount an ADFS image with the ``fuse_adfs.py``
utility, using the following syntax::

  fuse_adfs.py <mount point> -o image=<image path>

Note that the mount point must refer to an empty directory.


Unmounting an image
-------------------

When you have finished with an image, type::

  fusermount -u <mount point>

or type (possibly as root)::

  umount <mount point>
